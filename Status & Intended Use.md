Status

This repository is a public reference implementation intended to illustrate how civic or public-interest decision systems can be designed with explicit stages, explainable exclusions, and a complete audit trail.

It is not a description of any existing platform, nor a proposal for immediate adoption. It exists as a neutral, educational artifact for oversight, research, and policy discussion.
